            <p>Star Wars: Empire at War is a real-time strategy game which was released in February 2006 by Petroglyph Games, and published by LucasArts. It features the Rebel Alliance duking it out with the Galactic Empire for control of the galaxy. An Expansion pack released in October of the same year, called 'Forces of Corruption', expanding on the game's content and added a new pirate faction to the game called the Zann Consortium.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Recommended Changes to Controls:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I recommend changing the directional arrow keys to the directional WASD keys.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Useful Hotkeys to Remember:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>CTRL + A to select ALL UNITS</p>
            <br>
            <p>CRTL + Numbers 0-9 to assign units to GROUPS (You can have 10 different GROUPS)</p>
            <br>
            <h2>What are the different modes?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Tutorials
                    <p class="italtext">To learn the game</p>
                </li>
                <li>Campaign
                    <p class="italtext">Story mode for each of the three factions, Empire, Rebellion, & Consortium</p>
                </li>
                <li>Galactic Conquest
                    <p class="italtext">A more freestyle sandbox version of the story mode without campaign missions</p>
                </li>
                <li>Skirmish
                    <p class="italtext">Best described as an instant battle mode like in any other RTS game, there are three submodes, Land, Space, & Land Control</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What should you do first?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>You should obviously do the tutorials first, but I recommend doing the tutorials in the Forces of Corruption Expansion first, because they are basically the same the only difference being the expansion adds two new tutorial missions for the Zann Consortium itself. You do not need to do these, in fact you should save them until you intend to play the Zann Consortium campaign itself since they are basically the Prologue for their Campaign. This is just to ensure you don't have to do the tutorials again to play the prologue missions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After this you can close the game, then you can relaunch into Classic Empire at War (without FOC) and then you can choose to do the Rebel or Imperial Campaign. They both loosely follow the events of Star Wars: A New Hope. The Rebel Campaign is the "canonical" ending, meanwhile the Empire has an alternative history ending. Make of that what you will...</p>
            <br>
            <p>May the force be with you!</p>
