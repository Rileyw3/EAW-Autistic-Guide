            <p>To preface my criticism, this isn't to bash the modding community or be overly negative about it. I am overjoyed with the fact that one of my favourite childhood games has a decently sized and active modding community. I have enjoyed my time with these mods, although I must admit that I haven't even played Thrawn's Revenge, which is a little embarrassing on my end, and some may wish to discredit all of my criticisms on those grounds alone. Like how can I criticise Hoi4 modding if I haven't played Kaiserriech for instance? I have played Kaiserriech however, not very much but the point is, mod communities share ideas and features, and while I haven't played Thrawn's Revenge I can imagine that it shares the issues I have experienced with other mods, and I am pretty confident as to the interchangeability of my specific criticism between the different large mod projects. But as to ensure my criticism is a little less abstract I will be speaking of specific mods.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>1. Overwhelming Feedback</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I think this certainly is in line with the whole 'Autistic Guide' guide, I am aware that its likely not an issue for some of my neuro-brethren, but this is likely to effect many other users, neurotypicals included. A particular part of the issue is that mod makers wish to represent starships as accurately as possible, but this has the unfortunate side effect of greatly turning up the power scale of everything, and by extension adding an extremely large number of hardpoints to everything. Some of the turrets actually rotate like how they do in media which is cool as hell, but it can clutter starships with too many hardpoints making attacking some hardpoints at specific angles quite tedious.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The other side effect of starships being cluttered with hardpoints is it can result in dodgey balance, and enemy fleet spam which is really tedious to deal with. Many mods raise the fleet cap, this creates a larger micro requirement to combat the enemy, which for an RTS isn't a bad problem to have, but if you turn up all of the dials up, you can run into more performance issues on lower end systems, and it can make the game more straining to play because battles take longer, and have so much more going on in them.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>2. Kuat Brazzer Yards</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Come on fellas, you know what I mean, spaceships are fucking cool, but does the game UI really need to be pushed to its very limits by having every variant and prototype ISD to have ever been dreamed up by Intergalactic Space DARPA? In the base game there are 5 main Star Destroyer silhouettes, the Acclamator-class, the Victory-class, the Imperial-class, the Venator-class, and the  Executor-class. These all have vastly different silhouettes which are unmistakably different from each other. While this doesn't represent the full diversity of Imperial tech, the design language of Star Wars loves to make sure you can always tell apart what you're looking at just via the silhouette alone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to use the Remake mod as an example for this problem I call "Kuat Brazzer Yards Syndrome", the Remake mod purports to be a remake of the game itself, so how does the mod treat core mechanics like the rock-paper-scissors system, or avoid falling into total feature creep? Unfortunately the Remake mod is somewhat of a mess in these regards. Feature creep being a rather big one, but this is likely inherited from other mods.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What I want is a focused game which doesn't hyperfixate on starship porn. As much as I love starship porn like the next guy, I also like when there is more than only a couple backdrops and maps. For some reason the Remake mod has Los Santos from GTA 5 as a placeholder map for space battles. One moment I am enjoying beautiful sexy space battles which pull me into the setting... only for me to get a call on my phone from Michael De Santa asking about why I am showering his house with turbolasers. I am obviously joking, that doesn't actually happen, but it's quite frankly absurd that Los Santos is a placeholder map. The mod team need to really work on more planet variety, because currently the actual places these battles take place is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. Although the Kuat Drive Yard skirmish map is rather cool, but obviously it would be, because the map is peak Kuat Brazzer Yard content.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The rock-paper-scissors systems are not totally missing, but they are not shown. The Remake mod also doesn't have a tech tree in the game, which is rather frustrating because of how the tech level system works. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, the overabundance of ship options which you could drown in, but in terms of gameplay some simply become redundant. I think this could be solved by having tech level lock off some ship options as well, this may sound harsh, but if you have ISD-2's why would you still build ISD-1's? The base game even did this with the Z-95 Headhunter for the rebels, and while its sad to lock them off, the only thing that would need to change is giving the X-wing the ability to 'hunt for enemies' as well.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>3. Ahistoricism & BLOODY PIRATES</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Remake mod also features many different sub-factions, and even overhauls the Zann Consortium into a generic Underworld faction. The mod also features ships from KOTOR, SWTOR, the Clone Wars era, and etc. There is a slight problem with this, a lot of this is ahistorical. Imagine if you went to Ukraine and saw people with Bolt-Action Rifles invented in the 1890's... oh wait... I think regarding the hammerhead, and the Clone vessels these are fine as cameos to the arsenal much like the base game did with the Venator. But I am not a fan of fighting the Hutts with their Lucrehulk-classes to be entirely honest. Ship options should be refined a lot more in my view.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I am rather annoying. Aside from that, I have a few bone to picks in regards to the Remake mod and how it doesn't live up to how I would personally remake or retool the game. It's not that mods like this are bad, it's just they may not be for me, because I love vanilla icecream, and when something is labelled... BRAND NEW VANILLA ICECREAM! I get excited and expect vanilla icecream but sexier, I was somewhat disappointed. I don't want to take away what other people have or like, which is why I am not a Disney executive, but in regards to Empire at War mods, I gravitate more towards vanilla plus mods, rather than total conversions. Which makes me hope that more people also want vanilla plus mods. I really liked the original Republic at War mod, because mechanically it was just EAW but in the Clone Wars era. I even enjoyed the absurdist Russian mod aptly called Super Star Wars.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I guess what I am saying is that in a way I haven't touched Thrawn's Revenge because I like vanilla so much that the idea of playing the biggest of the big total conversion mods just doesn't appeal to me. This is totally fine and honestly Thrawn's Revenge has done absolute wonders for the Star Wars strategy community and even possibly indirectly inspired Petroglyph to extend their modding support for old Empire at War. So really I can't complain at all, I love that my childhood game is as popular as it is.</p>
            <br>
            <p>P.S. Star Wars Kuat Brazzer Yardist YouTubers, whenever there is an update to the big mods you play, can you please clarify that you are not talking about the base game getting updated, but instead say the specific mod in question. Please stop acting like the only reason people play these games still is just because of the big total conversion mods. I would like to stay updated about the ACTUAL updates pushed out by Petroglyph, like the saves fix.</p>
